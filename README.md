## Arduino

- [x] Wifi Connection
- [x] Make server requests via http protocol
- [ ] Read MPU6050 raw values,
- [ ] Processing => Detecting movment for certain time(threshold).
- [ ] Generate Alarm or bink led, or print to serial. if movment detected

  dependency => time, movement
  filter => to smooth values
  google: dectect movement using mpu6050,

## Sensor Reading Material:

In navigation, dead reckoning is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is path integration.
